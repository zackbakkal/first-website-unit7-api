			<h1>Why did we chooseArgan oil</h1>
			<div class="left description">
				<p>Referred to as "Liquid Gold" by Moroccans themselves. This oil is a plant oil extract from the
					Argania
					spinosa tree, a tree that is endemic in Morocco. It is constantly extracted and used because of its
					cosmetic
					and nutritive value. It also claims to have a lot of medicinal properties.
					This amazing oil contains some major vitamins and minerals essential for oneâ€™s health. It is known
					to have
					Vitamin C and E which are great antioxidants for the body thus it can counteract the effects of
					aging.
					The oil contains rare plant sterols (schottenol and spinasterol), not found in other oils. It is
					believed
					that these phytosterols are unique in their combination and that there are no other oils with a
					comparable
					phytosterol composition.</p>
				<p>Argan is considered an effective anti-aging oil due to properties such as the high levels of vitamin
					E/tocopherols
					(anti-oxidants help neutralize free radical damage, which is important for skin exposed to polluted
					Western environments)
					and saponins (skin-softening agents). Besides cooling and soothing inflammation, it is also reputed
					to help reduce wrinkles
					by restoring the skin`s hydro-lipid layer.
					Apply to any area of the body to relieve dryness, itchiness, inflammation or any other skin, hair or
					nail ailment.

				<h2>Bridget Mclean</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="right description">
				<p>Owner of K-Bree, Bridget Mclean was born and raised in Alberta, Canada. During her first visit to
					Morocco,
					Bridget was introduced to Argan oil while traveling to the south of Morocco, where Argania spinosa
					trees grow abundantly.
					After falling in love with this all natural oil and returning home with a small supply which she
					herself help hand press
					with other local woman, Bridget's supply starting to become low. After searching endlessly for a
					quality affordable
					Argan oil, disappointment set in. There was nothing comparable to what she had brought back from
					Morocco and anything
					somewhat close was outrageously expensive. While complaining to her husband Zakaria about this
					problem, Zakaria and
					Bridget decided to find a way to provide others with this amazing oil at reasonable prices and
					K-Bree was born.
					Currently in Calgary, Alberta Bridget is receiving the imports of K-Bree's products and preparing it
					for distribution to you.

				<h2>Zakaria Bakkal</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="right description">
				<p>Co-Owner of K-Bree, he was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco. Zakaria Bakkal grew up
					experiencing the benefits
					first hand of using both the cosmetic and edible Argan oil. When realizing how limited the options
					were for purchasing
					100 percent Pure Moroccan Argan oil outside of Morocco and knowing the amazing results obtained from
					using this natural
					resource. He teamed up with Bridget his wife and together they decided to offer this incredible
					natural product to you,
					in its purest form and at affordable prices! Currently in Morocco Zakaria is working hard to ensure
					the best supply of
					the fruit is readily available for K-Bree to produce. He over sees every step of the processing of
					our oil, from the
					harvesting of the fruit, to the filtering of the oil and securing the shipment to Canada.

				<h3>how do we get our oil</h3>
				<p>Since the idea began, Zakaria and Bridget have travelled to many locations across Southern Morocco.
					Visiting the farms
					learning and experiencing first hand the entire process in producing the oil. By educating ourselves
					on the various problems
					associated with the sourcing of our seeds through local woman co-ops we eventually decided against
					purchasing through them,
					as the underlying situation within the co-ops, goes against what we stand for, as a socialy
					responsible company.
					This decision was best suited for our company and the values we stand by.
					At K-BREE we use the cold press method for producing our oil.
